========================

First Kata (CodingDojo) developed in NCTU

Retrospective

Problem : Numbers to Roman Kata

Day : March 6

Participants:
- Marcus
- Laura
- Asus

:)
- It was interesting
- It was really nice to work on a language that most of people don't know (java. They have xp with C++)
- TDD is cool


:(
- We didn't discuss with the group a path to follow on the problem, so maybe everyone had different vision for the final source code solution
- Using Mac is hard for some users
- Mike was late
- As it was the first time, we talked too much while others were programming
- We didn't follow babysteps close to the end of the day
- We made source code without test

- It is very good to see people trying to understand. It was the first day in CodingDojo Methodology for most of the members.
